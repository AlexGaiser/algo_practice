The general step wise procedure for Big-O runtime analysis is as follows:

Figure out what the input is and what n represents.
Express the maximum number of operations, the algorithm performs in terms of n.
Eliminate all excluding the highest order terms.
Remove all the constant factors.

Examples:
▪ Logarithmic algorithm – O(logn) – Binary Search.
▪ Linear algorithm – O(n) – Linear Search.
▪ Superlinear algorithm – O(nlogn) – Heap Sort, Merge Sort.
▪ Polynomial algorithm – O(n^c) – Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bucket Sort.
▪ Exponential algorithm – O(c^n) – Tower of Hanoi.
▪ Factorial algorithm – O(n!) – Determinant Expansion by Minors, Brute force Search algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem.
